		<p class="caption">This is the concept art for sad!Web which was recommended to me by my trusty friends. The premise of sad!Web is that something tragic happens to each of the characters, making them uninterested in current favorite activities, never meet best friends, etc. My friends were talking about how my hand in sad!Web should be cut off to prevent me (Tom) from ever drawing comics. Unfortunately it's a good idea.</p>

		<p class="caption">This actually kinda scared me. As part of my stress drawing I drew my physics teacher and he commented on it. He now encourages and looks forward to seeing my drawings of myself on my tests so he knows that I am destressing.</p>

		<p class="caption">Later in the day during AP Physics class we were doing a lab practicum (which I learned later I aced *adjusts bowtie*) and we had plenty of extra time, so why not another doodle on the white board? To be truthful I was extremely nervous about getting a bad grade (stupid nerd kid me) so I was 'stress doodling'. Not my best work, but it certainly got some of the tension off.</p>

		<p class="caption">We had some free time in geometry class and I was on a roll with the logo (below) and of course I sat against the whiteboard in the back of the room, so obviously I had to do some classic whiteboard graffiti. The thought bubble reads "I have the answer but I will not raise my hand under any circumstance", and I wrote this because one of my neighboring desk people was a complete genius, but she refused to raise her hand. I came to realize that this applied to me too, so I wrote it down for reference.</p>

		<p class="caption">This was an absentminded doodle in my geometry paper and was later used to make the official Web Comics logo/watermark. Most of the detail got lost as the logo/watermark got small and was put onto the comic itself, but it still retains its original doodle frame.</p>
