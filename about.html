		<p><span class="spec">WEB COMICS</span> are a series of handmade paper comics created by Tom Child. The debut strip was two parts named 'The Spider: part one/two' consisting of Tom (the main character) and her friend (later named Tristan) discovering a large spider in Tom's house and combining the housecat (named Misty) with the spider.</p>
		<p>The comic's style is black and white with shading, however in later strips the comic has shown to include a red color. Following a popular style called an 'AU' (Alternate Universe) where the title is included with the AU name with an exclamation point at the end, an example being 'sad!Web' where the characters have extremely unfortunate accidents, causing them not to have particular likes. Tristan in sad!Web is hospitalized for unknown reasons and is shown never to speak. Some theories say that Tom (who is very cautious around Tristan in this AU) hurt him severely, thus severing their friendship. sad!Web Tom is presented with many problems caused by a disease slowly killing her brain, leading to her death.* </p>
		<p>*Author's Note: the disease, though it is not necessarily mentioned specifically in the comic, is called fatal familial insomnia. It is shown in several comics that Tom (me) suffers from insomnia, though in sad!Web it is taken to an all new level. Tom also has frequent nosebleeds which could relate to the slow death of her brain, including the fact that she mentions the reason why she doesn't do sports: 
		<p id="quote">"My leg seizes up sometimes, even my hand just starts jerking around. I can't control it, much less play sports when there's pressure to catch or kick something."</p>
		<p>Even in the original series Tom is shown with frequent nosebleeds and, without glasses, with blank eyes. This is popularly theorized as being a bridge to sad!Web, though it was never confirmed.</p>
